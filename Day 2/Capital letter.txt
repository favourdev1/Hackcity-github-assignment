Question write a pseudocode to convert string to capital

- we declare an array of string str and a variable i.
- We read the string and then we run while loop to get each character of the string. 
- We will check if each ASCII value of each character is between the value of a and z.
 -If yes, then subtract 32 from each character to convert them into capital letters.
